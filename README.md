Expert Usability Evaluation Assessment On Two E-commerceWebsites Using CognitiveWalkthrough Method

The paper presents a case study of GUI (Graphical User Interface) quality testing between two online shopping portals. The study
aimed to assess the user experience using the cognitive walkthrough method and collate it with expert opinions. In this study, there
were two significant findings. First, the result showed successful and unsuccessful features; pain points, and problems like simplicity,
consistency, familiarity that prevent users from accomplishing their goals. The absence of any of these key factors may diminish the
usability of web portals. Second, one of the vital causes to decrease the conversion rate is the lack of simplicity of the checkout design
that prevents consumers from purchasing from the marketplace.
